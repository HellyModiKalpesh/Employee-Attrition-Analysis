## Key Insights

1. **Tenure**
High-Risk Period: The majority of attrition occurs within the first 2-3 years of employment, especially among employees in their 20s and 30s.
Retention Strategy: Implement mentorship programs, leadership training, and personalized career opportunities to retain employees in this demographic.

2. **Salary and Benefits Packages**
Competitive Compensation: Lower salary increases are linked with higher attrition. Offering more competitive raises or bonus incentives could enhance satisfaction and retention.

3. **Work-Life Balance**
Flexible Options: High attrition correlates with poor work-life balance. Introducing flexible work hours, remote work, or reducing mandatory overtime may help retain employees.

4. **Education and Skill Mismatch**
Upskilling Opportunities: Employees with higher qualifications may feel underutilized, while those with lower qualifications may feel overwhelmed. Offering upskilling and more challenging roles can address these issues.

5. **Business Travel Impact**
Travel Reduction: Frequent business travel is linked with higher attrition. Consider reducing travel frequency or offering rewards and time off for frequent travelers to boost retention.

6. **Department-Specific Attrition**
Targeted Surveys: Certain departments have higher turnover. Conducting department-specific satisfaction surveys can help identify and resolve team-specific issues.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Improve Work-Life Balance**
Programs: Implement programs that promote a healthier work-life balance, including flexible work schedules, remote work options, or reduced mandatory overtime.

2. **Career Development**
Mentorship and Training: Offer career advancement opportunities through mentorship, leadership development, and regular skill enhancement programs, especially targeting employees in their first 2-3 years.

3. **Competitive Compensation**
Salary Adjustments: Address salary dissatisfaction by providing competitive raises and bonus structures that align with market standards.

4. **Education Alignment**
Skill Matching: Offer upskilling programs and challenging projects for highly qualified employees while supporting employees who feel overwhelmed with mentorship and job training.

5. **Business Travel Adjustments**
Incentives: Reduce travel frequency or provide additional incentives (such as time off or travel rewards) for employees with high travel demands.

6. **Departmental Focus**
Targeted Surveys: Conduct satisfaction surveys within high-attrition departments to address specific challenges that may be driving turnover in these areas.
